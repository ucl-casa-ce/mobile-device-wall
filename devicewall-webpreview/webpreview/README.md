# 📱🕸️ Flutter Web Preview 🕸️📱

Web Preview is a simple Flutter App that is deployed to devices on the Wall to allow users to preview websites.  Each device talks to a central server and receives commands to refresh and load web pages on the webview.  Users can inspect cookies and Local Storage on the WebView for debug purposes.
